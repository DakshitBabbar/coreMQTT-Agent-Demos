This directory contains Git submodules of the FreeRTOS and "core" libraries built
by the demo contained in this Git repository.  It also contains an implementation
of the MQTT agent interface functions that are specific to FreeRTOS.  The MQTT
agent interface provides the functions that send messages into and receive messages
from the MQTT agent task, as well as a thread safe pool of structures used with
those functions.
